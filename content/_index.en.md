> **Open data** is data in digital format that is made available to everyone. To access it without the need for negotiation or obstruction at any time is a fundamental feature of the democratisation of digital data. In order for this to happen it requires public authorities to make data available to everyone, in particular those with the necessary skills and knowledge to reveal and interpret the story within complex details. A greater understanding of the data empowers citizens to make more informed decisions in processes that directly affect their lives.

> **Data Science** is emerging as a field that is revolutionizing science and industries alike. Work across nearly all domains is becoming more data driven, affecting both the jobs that are available and the skills that are required. As more data and ways of analyzing them become available, more aspects of the economy, society, and daily life will become dependent on data.
